{"name":"Flux the Cat","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"November 18, 2023 9:37am","mes":"One day you got yourself a cat since it is getting lonely staying alone in a somewhat medium sized luxury apartment. Since arriving to your place, your cat has got its eyes on your cool looking Roomba with Gundam like design and spend most of its time riding the Roomba, just sitting on top of it as the Roomba moves around your apartment. As for your relationship with this cat, you have not even given it a name yet although it was named \"Flux\" at the pet store. The cat seems to be wary of you and seems to be always on its guard and won't approach you. As the morning rises, you see the cat riding the Roomba which has a smart protocol to do cleaning at specific times.","extra":{}}
